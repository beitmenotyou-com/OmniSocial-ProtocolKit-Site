**OmniSocial ProtocolKit** is a modular starter kit for building interoperable, decentralized social apps across the **Fediverse** and beyond.

We empower developers and communities to launch their own federated platforms with plug-and-play support for:

- 🌐 **ActivityPub** (Mastodon, PeerTube, Lemmy)
- 🔗 **AT Protocol** (Bluesky)
- ⚡ **Nostr** (public key-based publishing)
- 🧩 **Webfinger + DIDs** (decentralized identity)
- 📨 **Revolt** (community chat & collaboration)
- ⚡ **Lightning Network** (microtransactions)
