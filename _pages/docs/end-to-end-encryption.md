# 🔐 End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) Implementation

OmniSocial ProtocolKit offers **modular end-to-end encryption (E2EE)** for messaging, private content, and identity-related operations — all while respecting decentralization, user control, and privacy-by-design.

We use a layered approach to encryption so that developers can choose their desired stack based on use case and threat model.

---

## 🧩 Encryption Stack Options

### 🔑 **OpenPGP.js**
- Built-in by default for encrypting private posts and pay-to-unlock content
- Enables keypair-based encryption using standard PGP methods
- Used for creator-protected content (e.g., pay-to-view posts)

### 📨 **Matrix (Optional Module)**
- Offers full E2EE for 1:1 and group messaging
- Based on the [Olm/Megolm](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/) protocol
- Can be self-hosted via a Matrix homeserver
- Use Element Web for frontend or embed directly in the UI

### 📡 **Nostr DMs (NIP-04)**
- Encrypts direct messages using shared secret derived from secp256k1 keys
- Lightweight but lacks forward secrecy
- Enabled by default for Nostr-based user-to-user chats

## 🔧 E2EE Use Cases

| Use Case                          | Encryption Method     |
|----------------------------------|------------------------|
| Pay-to-view post                 | OpenPGP.js            |
| Private DM (Matrix module)       | Matrix Olm/Megolm     |
| Private DM (Nostr)               | NIP-04 (secp256k1)     |
| Encrypted identity backups       | OpenPGP.js            |
| Creator subscriber-only content  | OpenPGP.js + Lightning|

---

## 📁 Key Management

All encryption modules rely on **local key generation** — meaning users retain full control of their private keys.

We do **not** store keys server-side. Options include:
- Nostr keypairs stored in-browser or synced via encrypted backup
- OpenPGP keys generated at profile creation (or imported)
- Matrix sessions protected via SSSS and cross-signing

---

## 🛠️ Integrating Custom E2EE Modules

OmniSocial supports a `crypto/` folder where you can drop in:
- Custom E2EE wrappers for protocols
- Key management UIs
- Identity verification tools (e.g., PGP-signed attestations)

Each module must export:
- `encrypt(content, pubkey)`
- `decrypt(encrypted, privkey)`
- `generateKeypair()`

---

## 🧪 Privacy Principles

We apply the following principles to all E2EE features:

- **No server-side key storage**
- **User consent before encryption**
- **Optional forwarding secrecy (via Matrix)**
- **Pluggable encryption methods**
- **Interoperable key formats where possible**

> OmniSocial believes encryption should be accessible, modular, and truly end-to-end — not just buzzwords. If you control your keys, you control your freedom.
